# Intelligent Transport System (ITS)
The primary objective of this repository is to centralize and maintain the source code produced 
as part of my scientific initiation research. The goal is optimizing the public transport system 
using a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) approach. By sharing the code, I aim to 
contribute to the advancement of knowledge in this area and facilitate future research efforts.
# Source code
